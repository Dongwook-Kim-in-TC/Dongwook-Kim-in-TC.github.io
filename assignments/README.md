All assignments should be word-processed. You do not need to include the actual question with your response, unless it is helpful for you. On the day the assignment is due (or before) bring your printed answers to class. If you are working with other students, include all of yuor names on the assignment and only turn in one assignment per group. Lastly, any figures, equations, or R syntax/output included in the assignments should adhere to the following:

- **Typesetting R Syntax:** R syntax should be set in a [monospaced font](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font). This will help keep syntax and output formatted and consistent. Common monspaed fonts include Courier, Inconsolata, and Source Code Pro. Here is [a list of other monspaced fonts for typesetting computer code](http://typecast.com/blog/10-fonts-for-code), many of which can be downloaded for free. 

- **Figures:** All graphics and figures should be resized so that they do not take up more room than necessary and should have an appropriate caption and labels. If you are printing in black-and-white, be sure that any color used to differentiate objects in the plot is differentiable after printing. If not, use a greyscale palette.

- **Equations:** Any typed mathematics (equations, matrices, vectors, etc.) should be appropriately typeset within the document using Equation Editor ([YouTube video about how to use Equation Editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cir8RXGTEq8)), Markdown, or LaTeX. This ensures that the spacing and size are appropriate. It also makes adding greek letters, mathematics symbols, and things like a hat fairly easy.
