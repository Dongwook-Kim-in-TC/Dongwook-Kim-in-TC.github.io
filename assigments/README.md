Formatting
-------

As of Assignment \#6, you will no longer be reqired to use "strict" APA formatting for figures, tables, and equations. The following formatting guide will lay out the important parts to formatting these things.


### Tables

The following formatting should be used for all tables you create in the assignments:

- _Numbering:_ All tables should be numbered in the order they appear in your assignment. Use a regular (non-italics, non-bold) font for this and roman numbering. e.g., Table 1 *or* Table 4. This should be left-justified on the page and shoulf be above the table. The word "table" should be capitalized as it is the name of the table. There should not be any punctuation after the table number.
- _Captioning:_ The table caption should begin on the subsequent line after "Table X". This should also be left-justified. Use an italics font, and capitalize all important first letters of words (similar to APA).
- _Borders:_ There should be no vertical borders in the table. The header row(s) should have a horizontal border above and below the row (similar to APA-styled tables). There should also be a horizontal border under the last row in the table. (All table notes should be below this last border.)
- _Table Notes:_ These should be left justified. The font size should be 1&ndash;2 sizes smaller than than the font used for the table. In general, each note should begin on a new line. The first note should have _Note._ written in italics (the exception is if the only note is a probability note (e.g., p < .05), in which case _Note._ is not needed).

When table columns include numbers (e.g., regression coefficients, standard errors) the decimal points should be vertically aligned. This will help your reader interpret magnitude and make easier comparisons between the values.


### Figures

The following formatting should be used for all figures you create in the assignments:

- _Numbering:_ All figures should be numbered in the order they appear in your assignment. Use an italics, non-bold font for this and roman numbering followed by a period, e.g., _Figure 1._ or _Figure 4._ This should be left-justified on the page and appear below the actual figure.
- _Captioning:_ The figure caption should start on the same line as "_Figure X._" Use a non-italics, non-bold font, and capitalize only the first letter of each sentence in the caption (abbreviations, etc. should also be capitalized if they appear in the caption).


### Equations

The following formatting should be used for all equations you create in the assignments:

- _Numbering:_ All equations should be numbered in the order they appear in your assignment. Use a non-italics, non-bold font for this and roman numbering. The number should be placed inside parentheses and should be right-justified on the page.
- _Equation:_ The equation itself should be centered on the page.

All equations should be typeset using an equation editor. This ensures that the spacing and size are appropriate. It also makes adding greek letters, mathematics symbols, and things like a hat fairly easy.
