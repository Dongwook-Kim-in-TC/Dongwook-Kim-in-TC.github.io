### Figures

All graphics and figures should be resized so that they do not take up more room than necessary and should have an appropriate caption and labels.


### Equations

Any typed mathematics (equations, matrices, vectors, etc.) should be appropriately typeset within the document using Equation Editor, Markdown, or LaTeX. This ensures that the spacing and size are appropriate. It also makes adding greek letters, mathematics symbols, and things like a hat fairly easy. 


### Hints for Assignment 2

This [response to a Stack Overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7476022/geom-point-and-geom-line-for-multiple-datasets-on-same-graph-in-ggplot2) may get you started in thinking about how to get two separate lines on the plot you need to make.
